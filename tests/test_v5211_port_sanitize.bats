# v5.21.1: AWG_PORT from awgsetup_cfg.init is normalized before use.
#
# The config file is hand-edited, so a bad edit can leave any string in
# AWG_PORT. That value reached several places unchecked:
#   - the check --json envelope, interpolated without quotes, so a non-numeric
#     value produced "number":abc - not parseable, which breaks the v5.21.0
#     promise of exactly one valid JSON document;
#   - [[ "$port" -eq 0 ]], an arithmetic context where bash performs command
#     substitution, so a value like a[$(cmd)] executed cmd;
#   - the UFW rule regex, where a value like '.*' matched any rule.
#
# These tests run the real _sanitize_port pulled out of the scripts, not a
# local copy of the logic - a grep-for-the-regex test would pass even if the
# function were never called.
